            <p class="text-muted">Yes, you can study market conditions and build your own portfolio if you have the time, knowledge, and expertise to do so. However, it is recommended to seek the advice of a financial consultant if you are new to investing or if you want to make sure that your investments are aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Financial consultants have access to more resources, including market analysis and research, and can provide personalized advice based on your individual needs and circumstances. Additionally, they can help you monitor and adjust your portfolio as needed, which can be particularly valuable if you have a busy schedule or if you are not comfortable making investment decisions on your own. Financial consultants help clients build portfolios by offering investment advice and recommendations based on the client's financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment time horizon. They consider various investment options, such as insurance, mutual funds, fixed deposits, gold, real estate, and others, and recommend a suitable mix of assets to diversify the portfolio and maximize returns while minimizing risk. The portfolio is periodically reviewed and adjusted based on changes in the client's financial situation and market conditions.</p>
