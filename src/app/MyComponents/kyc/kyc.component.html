<h4>KYC</h4>
<p>KYC stands for "Know Your Customer" and refers to the process of verifying the identity of a customer or client by a financial institution, such as a bank, an insurance company, or a securities firm. The purpose of KYC is to prevent financial fraud and money laundering by ensuring that the institution knows who its customers are and their financial activities.</p>
<p>The KYC process typically involves collecting and verifying information about the customer, such as their name, address, date of birth, and identification number, and determining the customer's risk level based on their financial activities and transaction patterns. The information collected is then used to verify the customer's identity and monitor their transactions for any suspicious activities.</p>
<p>KYC is an important part of compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) regulations. Financial institutions are required to follow KYC procedures to ensure they are not involved in illegal financial activities, such as money laundering, fraud, or financing terrorism.</p>
<p>The KYC process may be conducted in person, online, or through other means, and may involve additional verification procedures, such as document verification or biometric authentication.</p>

<h4>eKYC</h4>
<p>eKYC (Electronic Know Your Customer) is an online process for verifying a customer's identity in India. It enables customers to open bank accounts, purchase insurance policies, and access other financial services without having to physically visit the financial institution.</p>
<p>In India, eKYC is facilitated by the UIDAI (Unique Identification Authority of India) through its Aadhaar platform, which provides a secure and centralized database of demographic and biometric information of Indian residents. The UIDAI offers APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow financial institutions to integrate eKYC into their systems and processes.</p>
<p>Customers can provide their Aadhaar number and biometric information, such as their fingerprint or iris scan, to the financial institution, which can then be verified against the UIDAI database. This allows the institution to quickly and securely verify the customer's identity without having to rely on physical documents.</p>
<p>The eKYC process has made it easier and more convenient for customers to access financial services, and has also reduced the cost and time involved in traditional KYC processes for financial institutions.</p>
