        Life insurance is a contract between an individual and an insurance
        company that provides financial coverage in the event of the
        policyholder's death. The policyholder pays a premium, and in return,
        the insurance company provides a death benefit to the designated
        beneficiaries. The purpose of life insurance is to provide financial
        security to the policyholder's loved ones and to help them maintain
        their standard of living in the event of the policyholder's death. It's
        an important component of financial planning, especially for those with
        dependents who rely on their income. When planning for life insurance,
        it's important to consider factors such as the amount of coverage
        needed, the type of policy, and the premium payments that fit within
        your budget.
