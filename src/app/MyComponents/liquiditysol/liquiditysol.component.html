            <p class="text-muted">Liquid mutual funds invest in highly liquid and low-risk securities such as government bonds and money market instruments, and provide relatively low returns. They can be used to park money temporarily and provide access to funds when needed.</p>

            <p class="text-muted">Short-term mutual funds invest in a combination of debt and money market instruments with a slightly higher risk profile than liquid funds. They are designed to provide higher returns than liquid funds over the short-term, usually with a horizon of 1-3 years.</p>

            <p class="text-muted">Short-term fixed deposits are low-risk investment instruments offered by banks and other financial institutions. They offer a fixed rate of return for a specified period, usually ranging from 1-3 years.</p>

            <p class="text-muted">It's important to consider your individual financial goals and risk tolerance when choosing a liquidity solution. It is also important to review and understand the features, fees, and risks associated with each investment product, and to consult with a financial advisor if necessary.</p>

            <p class="text-muted">It is generally recommended to have a portion of your portfolio in low-risk and highly liquid investments to meet unexpected expenses or emergencies. This helps ensure that you have access to funds when you need them and reduces the risk of having to sell investments at a loss in a market downturn.</p>
