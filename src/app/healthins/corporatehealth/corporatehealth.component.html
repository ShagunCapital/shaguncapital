    <h4>What is Corporate Health Plan?</h4>
    <p>A corporate health plan is a type of health insurance that is offered by an employer to its employees. These plans typically provide comprehensive coverage for medical expenses, including doctor visits, hospital stays, prescription drugs, and preventive care.</p>
    <p>Employers usually offer a choice of health plans to their employees, and the employee typically pays a portion of the premium through payroll deductions. The employer may also contribute to the cost of the premium, depending on the plan. Corporate health plans can be either self-insured, meaning the employer sets aside funds to pay for employee medical expenses, or fully-insured, meaning the employer purchases insurance from an insurance company.</p>
    <p>Corporate health plans can be preferred by employees as they are often more affordable and offer more coverage options than individual plans. They can also offer additional benefits such as wellness programs and employee assistance programs.</p>
