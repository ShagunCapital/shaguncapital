    <h4>What is Regular Pay Fund?</h4>
    <p>Regular Pay Fund in Mutual Funds refers to a type of mutual fund scheme where investors have the option to make systematic investments on a regular basis, usually on a monthly or quarterly basis. These investments are typically made through automatic debit from the investor's bank account. The objective of regular pay funds is to enable investors to save a small amount regularly and accumulate wealth over time through the power of compounding.</p>

    <br>
    <h4>Regular Pay Funds</h4>
    <p>Almost all health insurance companies in India provide family floater health plans. Some of the companies are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>ICICI Lombard</li>
        <br>
        <li>Max Bupa</li>
        <br>
        <li>HDFC Ergo</li>
        <br>
        <li>Star Health</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <h4>What is the Purpose of a Regular Pay Fund?</h4>
    <p>The primary purpose of a retirement savings fund is to create a steady source of revenue for an investor when he or she does not have a source of income. It can be considered as a form of deferred pay, providing financial security and enough capital to pay for the necessities of individuals.</p>
    <p>Most pension funds offer the option to receive the returns as either monthly annuity, or in a lump sum amount. Monthly annuity is paid at a fixed rate, in most cases including inflation protection. It is one of the most important advantages as an investor receives the return from their retirement fund adjusted to present denomination.</p>
    <p>Lump sum payments disburse the total amount of accumulated wealth to the investor after he or she retires. It allocates a substantial financial backing, however, removes the regular source of return from monthly annuity payments.</p>

    <br>
    <h4>Who Should Invest In A Regular Pay Fund?</h4>
    <p>Pension plans offer a source of finance to pay for everyday necessities as well as any unforeseen circumstances. These mutual fund retirement plans carry much less risk than other forms of investments, making them ideal to secure assured returns for senior citizens.</p>
    <p>Moreover, an investor can choose from several different types of pension funds available in India, allowing them to plan according to their unique financial needs.</p>
    <p>There are primarily 3 different plans one can choose from. The most popular plan solely invests in debt profiles, making them extremely safe and ideal for a conservative borrower. There are also plans that are unit-linked, investing in both equity, and debt profiles equally. These present slightly higher risk, however, offer higher returns as well.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, investors can also opt for National Pension Schemes, Government-backed retirement funds. This scheme allows investment in both debt and equity market according to an investor’s preference; one can also withdraw 60% of the total fund at the time of retirement and utilise the remaining 40% as annuity payment. The maturity amount is tax-free.</p>

    <br>
    <h4>What Should be the Mode of Investing?</h4>
    <p>There are primarily 2 ways to invest in these types of the fund; one can either choose to make a one-time lumpsum investment or opt to invest via a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>One time investment – One-time investment, or lumpsum investment, is a process where an investor capitalises a substantial amount at one go. This method is usually preferred by individuals with a healthy cash reserve and higher risk appetite.</li>
        <br>
        <li>SIP – Also known as Systematic Investment Plan, SIPs involve investing a certain sum of money every month till an investor fulfils his or her investment goal.</li>
        <br>
    </ul>
    <p>Both the above-mentioned processes offer certain merits as well as shortcomings. For example, lumpsum investments promise significantly higher returns with market appreciation. However, they are also exposed to more risks when compared to SIPs. Worth mentioning, only seasoned investors prefer such one-time investments.</p>

    <br>
    <b>Q2. Should I opt for a separate family health plan if I am covered by my office?</b>
    <p>A personal family health plan is always recommended so that you can get it done according to your need and requirement. In case you change that job, your corporate health plan will also end and it might happen that your new plan does not include the needed coverage.</p>
