    <h4>What is Higher Education Fund?</h4>
    <p>A Higher Education Fund Mutual Fund is a type of mutual fund that is specifically designed to help investors save for their children's or their own higher education expenses. These funds invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other securities, with the goal of achieving long-term growth to help pay for college expenses such as tuition, room, and board. Many Higher Education Fund Mutual Funds have a "target date" feature, which means that the fund's asset allocation will gradually become more conservative as the target date (usually the date when the child is expected to start college) approaches. This helps to minimize the risk of losing the invested money close to the time of the higher education expenses.</p>

    <br>
