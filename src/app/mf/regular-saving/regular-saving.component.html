    <h4>What is Regular Saving Fund?</h4>
    <p>A Regular Saving Fund, also known as a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP), is a type of mutual fund investment in which an individual invests a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, typically monthly. This type of investment plan allows individuals to invest small amounts of money over time, rather than a lump sum, making it more accessible for those with limited funds. SIPs also benefit from the power of compounding, which can result in higher returns over the long-term.</p>

    <br>
    <h4>Regular Saving Funds</h4>
    <p>Here are a few examples of popular Regular Saving Funds (SIPs):</p>

        <li>HDFC Small Cap Fund: This fund invests primarily in small cap stocks and has a consistent track record of delivering high returns over the long-term.</li>
