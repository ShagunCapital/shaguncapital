    <h4>What is Higher Study Plan?</h4>
    <p>Higher Study Plan in Life Insurance is a type of insurance policy that allows policyholders to use the death benefit to pay for their children's education expenses after they pass away. The policy typically includes a cash value component that can be used to pay for the child's education expenses, such as tuition and books, while they are still alive. The policyholder can also choose to use the cash value to pay for their own education expenses, such as continuing education or vocational training. This type of policy can be a good option for parents who want to ensure that their children have the means to pay for their education in the event of the policyholder's death.</p>
