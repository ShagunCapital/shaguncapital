        <h4>What is Children Insurance Plan?</h4>
        <p>A children's insurance plan is a type of life insurance policy that is specifically designed to provide
            financial protection for children. The main goal of a children's insurance plan is to provide a lump sum
            benefit to the child in the event of the death of the policyholder, typically the parent. The benefit can be
            used for the child's education, marriage, or other expenses.</p>
        <p>These plans are generally purchased by parents or grandparents for their children or grandchildren as a way
            to ensure that the child will have financial resources available to them in the future. The premium for a
            children's insurance plan is usually lower than that of a traditional life insurance policy because the
            death benefit is typically lower and the policy is in force for a shorter period of time.</p>
        <p>A children's insurance plan can also include some additional benefits like providing coverage for accidental
            death and permanent total disability, Critical illnesses and many more.</p>
        <p>It's important to carefully review the terms and conditions of a children's insurance plan before purchasing
            it to ensure that it meets your needs and provides the level of protection that you desire for your child.
