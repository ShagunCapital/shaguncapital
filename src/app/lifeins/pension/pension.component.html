    <h4>What is Pension Plan?</h4>
    <p>A pension plan in life insurance is a type of retirement savings plan that provides a guaranteed stream of income to the policyholder after they retire. These plans are typically purchased by individuals who want to ensure they have a steady source of income during their retirement years. The policyholder pays regular premiums into the plan while they are working, and when they retire, the insurance company pays out a regular income to the policyholder, often for the rest of their life. Some pension plans also have a death benefit, which provides for the policyholder's beneficiaries if the policyholder dies before they reach retirement age.</p>

    <br>
    <h4>What all Pension Plan Covers?</h4>
    <p>A pension plan in life insurance typically covers several key features, including:</p>
    <p><b>Investment options:</b> The individual can choose from a variety of investment options, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, to help grow their savings.</p>
    <p><b>Annuity:</b> Upon retirement, the individual can use the accumulated funds to purchase an annuity, which provides a guaranteed income for the remainder of their life.</p>
    <p><b>Death benefit:</b> The plan typically includes a death benefit, which provides a lump-sum payment to the individual's beneficiaries in the event of their death before retirement.</p>
    <p><b>Tax benefits:</b> Pension plans in life insurance offer tax benefits, which can help to reduce the individual's overall tax liability.</p>
    <p><b>Flexibility:</b> Many pension plans allow flexibility to change the investment options, contributions and other features as per the individual's needs and financial goals.</p>
    <p><b>Guaranteed returns:</b> Some pension plans offer guaranteed returns on the invested amount, which can provide a sense of security to the individual.</p>
    <p><b>Additional benefits:</b> Some pension plans also offer additional benefits such as accidental death cover, disability cover, and critical illness cover.</p>

    <br>
