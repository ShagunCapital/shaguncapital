    <h4>What is Wealth Builder Plan?</h4>
    <p>A family floater health insurance is a contract between you and the insurance company wherein, the company meets the medical expenses of the entire family in lieu of the annual premium paid by you. As part of this health insurance, the company pays for the expenses in case of any medical emergency.</p>
    <p>Under a family floater health insurance, a single health plan covers the entire family, and you pay one common premium for every family member. It usually covers a family of four members, which include the policyholder, his/her spouse, and up to four children. However, some plans also provide risk coverage for the policyholder’s parents and parents-in-law. Extended family (with in-laws) can also be covered in the family floater by paying some additional premium.</p>
